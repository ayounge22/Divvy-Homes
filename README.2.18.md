## Overview and Origin

* [Divvy Homes](https://www.divvyhomes.com/)

* Founded in 2017

* Founders include Adena Hefets, Alex Klarfield, and Nick Clark

* Divvy Homes started as a way for people to be able to save for the down payment of their dream home while living in it. Divvy acts as a path to homeownership for people who may not be able to purchase immediately, but can in the near future.

* Their initial funding started with Series A-D funding. They have since entered around [$735 million](https://blog.divvyhomes.com/2021/10/12/divvy-homes-announces-735m-debt-financing-just-two-months-after-raising-200-million-in-series-d/) in debt financing and is valued at around [$2 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/tiger-bets-on-divvy-homes-as-startup-hits-2-billion-valuation) in total they have gathered about $1.2 billion. 


## Business Activities:

* Divvy Homes wants to provide an opportunity individuals to become homeowner through the rent-to-own model. They buy the home for the applicant, thus Divvy becoming the landlord, and over their 3 year program, the rent is split into a down payment for the house and rent for living in the space.

* The intended customer are those who want to own a home in the near future, but do not have the resources for the down payment right now. This customer also needs to increase the size of their current living situation, which increases the demand for looking for a home. This was especially beneficial to them during the beginning of the pandemic because more and more families moved due to being at home more.

* The best advantage Divvy Homes hold is giving the tenant the ability cash out what they have saved up for the down payment and being able to buy the home at a slightly discounted rate if the person can buyback earlier. Touching on the cash out opportunity given to the tenant, this is simultaneously a disadvantage because if the market is not in the sellers favor, Divvy would either take a loss, or not gain as much profit.

* It is important to point out that Divvy Homes works with [Divvy](https://getdivvy.com/), a Bill.com company. These companies are generally using money management software such as mobile banking and payment, and more relevant to Divvy Homes they are likely using robo-advising like features when their tenants are in the planning phase to buyback the home. 


## Landscape:

* Divvy Homes is in the loan and financing industry, which that has become very restrictive for young people and growing families balancing everyday life. Specific to the mortgage industry, more and more people are finding it harder to qualify for mortgages thus creating longtime renting.
    
    Divvy is also in the [iBuyer](https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/what-is-an-ibuyer) industry. By allowing people to instantly have access to their home and when they are able to buy the home, Divvy Homes does most of the leg work.

* One of the key factors used in the mortgage industry today are pre-approval systems that are more technologically automated. The mortgage industry uses [data to pre-populate applications](https://www.somametrics.com/future-big-data-mortgage-industry/), thus trying to create a non-biased approval system and [expanding their customer base](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/13/how-technology-is-breathing-life-into-the-mortgage-industry/?sh=4e85ecc7242e).

* Divvy Homes' largest competitors include Redfin, Zillow, Trulia, HotPads, etc., but they set themselves apart by having the rent-to-own model. A similar company that uses the rent-to-own model is the company [Withco](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/01/withco-closes-on-32m-to-help-smbs-own-and-not-lease-the-buildings-they-occupy/), but that is oriented towards commercial spaces.


## Results

* Socially, Divvy has a positive impact in up and coming neighborhoods and young families. Technological wise, by using AI and machine learning, Divvy Homes can identify which areas are best to offer to and which applicants have the highest chance for success.

* Divvy Homes measures success by how many twnats are able to buy back their home. I was not able to find any success rates by their own measurement, but based on personal success stories, this can successfully work for [families](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/business/divvy-homes-real-estate-homes.html).

* Since there are only two companies using this model, but in a different real estate industry (Withco as an examples), it is hard to tell how well they perform comparatively.


## Recommendations

* One of my primary reccomendations would be including home improvement financing during the "renting". However that proves a large risk for Divvy because if things change for the current tenant and they choose to cash out their down payment savings during the improvements, they would face an unnecessary loss. One way to mitigate those losses would be to limit the cost of improvements or possibly having a repayment process.

* Offering this service is beneficial to Divvy because it expands the amount of people who have a particular dream home in mind, but don't have the resources to buy and update it.

* Divvy Homes would not need any new technology to run this aspect of the business, but instead, they would just expand on their current technologies to incorporate it. This expansion would include market predicting in the construction industry, which is supported through Divvy, their parent company.
